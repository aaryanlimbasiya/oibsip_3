# PROBLEM:

Price of a car depends upon various factors like goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and manymore. and this is the major area of research in ML.

# OBJECTIVE:

We have to train a model that accurately gives outcome about price prediction of the car.

# KEY INSIGHTS:

01.Load the Data: Loading the car price dataset and displaying its structure.

02.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables.

03.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables and correlation matrix.

04.Feature Selection and Data Splitting: Selecting features and splitting data into training and testing sets.

05.Data Standardization: Standardizing the feature data.

06.Model Training: Training the Linear Regression model.

07.Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using mean squared error and R^2 score, and plotting actual vs predicted prices.
